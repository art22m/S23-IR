Thus, we will retrieve some information from [this news article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59944889). Your task is to write a code, which will answer the question: **How many people die every day in the US waiting for a transplant?** Write flexible enough code. Test yourself by changing the link to [this one](https://www.americantransplantfoundation.org/about-transplant/facts-and-myths/)."
